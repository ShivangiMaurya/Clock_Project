# Clock Project ðŸš€

The Digital Clock is a JavaScript project that dynamically displays the current time in either a 12-hour or 24-hour format. It provides a real-time view of the hours, 
minutes, and seconds, updating every second. This simple project showcases the use of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.

## Features
- Dynamic Time Update: The clock updates every second to ensure real-time accuracy.
- 12-Hour and 24-Hour Formats: Users can toggle between 12-hour (with AM/PM) and 24-hour formats using a button.
- Responsive Design: The clock is styled to look visually appealing on various screen sizes.
- Interactive Button: A button allows users to switch formats dynamically, enhancing interactivity.


## How it works
The clock will show you a real-time view of the hours, minutes, and seconds, updating every second. This simple project showcases the use of HTML for structure, 
CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.
  
Hereâ€™s a quick overview of how it works:
- Time Retrieval: The current time is retrieved using the Date object in JavaScript.
- Formatting: The hours, minutes, and seconds are extracted and formatted based on the selected format (12-hour or 24-hour).
- Dynamic Update: The clock is updated every second using the setInterval() method.
- Click the "Switch to 24-Hour" or "Switch to 12-Hour" button to toggle between formats.
- User Interaction: A button toggles between 12-hour and 24-hour formats, with the text of the button updating accordingly.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**:  To create the structure of the clock.
- **CSS3**: To design the layout and style the elements for a modern look.
- **JavaScript**: To implement the logic for time display and format toggling.
